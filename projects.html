  <h1 style="position: relative; left: 550px;">Automated Attendance System</h1>
    <img src="FR.jpg" style="position: relative; left: 515px; height: 300px; width: 500px;">
    <h2 style="position: relative; left: 730px; font-size: medium;font-weight: 1000;"> Duration:8 weeks</h2>
    <h2 style="position: relative; left: 740px; font-size: medium; font-weight: 1000;"> Major Project</h2>
    <p style="border: 30px; margin-left: 50px; font-size: large;">The aim is to develop the automated system for detection and recognition of faces using their images from videos and recording the 
    attendance of the students by identifying him/her from their variant facial features. This helps to maintain and handle the attendance system automatically without any human intervention. This new system can ease the hectic attendance maintenance and handling the attendance will be more precise and
     efficient. The proposed system contributes to human face detection with the help of Viola Jones algorithm and face recognition with Fisher Face algorithm and achieves accuracy of 45% to 50%.</p><br>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;font-size: large;">Implementation steps:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">A. Interface:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: large;">1)When the application is executed, a pop-up window
      appears asking for the login details. We need to select
      the type of user i.e. Admin or faculty. <br>
      2)Login as Admin is made where the correct username and
      password needs to be entered for authentication.<br>
      3)The Admin is authenticated. The admin is authorized to
      create new faculty users. Hence after verification a
      window appears as shown. The menu bar shows three
      options. They are Add Faculty, which is used to create a
      new user. <br>
      4)The Admin creates new faculty user by clicking on the
      “Add Faculty” button provided on the menu bar. <br>
      5) The Username and Password is entered into the pop-up
      window. After entering the required fields, the data is
      securely verified and stored into the database by
      clicking the “Save” button.<br>
      6)After saving the username and password into the
      database, a message box appears showing that the
      transaction has been successful.<br>
      7)The View Faculty option on the menu bar is clicked by
      the Admin to view the Table in which the username and
      password of all the users are stored. This privilege is
      granted only to the Admin. No other user will be able to
      access this table in the database. Another window
      appears which shows the database table.</p><br><br><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">B. Faculty/Staff Login:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;font-size: large;">1)The User type which is going to login is Faculty user.
      The user needs to select the correct user type from the
      drop-down list otherwise the user will not be
      authenticated even if he/she has entered the correct
      username and password.<br>
      2)After the validation and authentication of the new user.
      The “Face Detection and recognition” form appears on
      the screen. The user need to click on the “Detect and
      recognize” button in order to open the camera
      application.<br>

      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">C. Detection and Enrolment:<p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;font-size: large;">1)If the student is not enrolled into the system, he/she can
      be enrolled by training the system. The student need to
      sit in front of the camera. Their face image will be
      extracted by the system and the user need to fill up the
      appropriate details given in the form. The “Add face”
      button is clicked. It stores all the student details into the
      database.<br>
      2)If the student is already enrolled. Then after clicking on
      the “Detect and recognize” button the system will detect
      and extract a new image of the student. It will recognize
      the user by using the algorithm and the image database
      used during enrolment.<br>
      3)The students name will appear on the edge of the frame.
      The student details appear on the results box. The
      student need to select the appropriate date and then click
      on the “Attendance” button. A message box appears
      which shows that the students attendance is marked in
      the database.<br>
      4)When we click on the “View” button, another window
      appears which displays the attendance database table in
      which the students’ attendance is marked.
      5)When “Generate Report” button is clicked. A window
      appears which has a drop-down list for selecting the
      month and the year of which a report is to be generated.
      It shows a message box “Done” if the report generation
      is completed. <br> </p>
